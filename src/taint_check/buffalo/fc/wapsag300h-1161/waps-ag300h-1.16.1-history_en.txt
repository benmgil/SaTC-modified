 Version 1.16.1 (release date: 2015/10/28)
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modified features from v1.14.0 to v1.16.1 are listed below:

(Firmware Update）
 - Disables wireless functionality during firmware update because firmware may not be updated successfully when wireless functionality is enabled. Because of this modification, the progress bar will not refresh if the device is connected to the AirStation wirelessly. After the diag LED turns off, log in to Settings and check if the firmware version was updated.

(Wireless)
 - "STA Exceed maximum STA number of SSID." message will be displayed on syslog when the maximum number of connected devices (configured in "Load Balancing" section on "Security" page) is reached.

 - The signal strength displayed on "Wireless Monitor" and "Clients" page is described using RSSI(dBm).

(RADIUS)
 - Session timeout will be 60 seconds when an unconfigurable value (1-59 seconds) is set.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed bugs from v1.14.0 to v1.16.1 are listed below:

(Wireless)
 - Fixed the issue where 11g beacon sometimes stopped.

(VLAN)
 - Fixed the issue where multiple VLAN settings did not function properly.

(RADIUS)
 - Modified to reauthenticate without disconnecting wireless connection from a client after the session timeout if "Termination Action" attribute is "RADIUS-Request".

 - Fixed the issue where some wireless clients could not be authenticated using EAP authentication.

(WDS)
 - Fixed the issue where the AirStation sometimes could not communicate with any registered access points when a MAC address on the access point list was deleted on [Wireless Settings] - [WDS] page.

 - Fixed the issue where the wireless throughput sometimes dropped about 10-20% if VLAN settings of wired interface or WDS interface were changed when using WDS.

(USB Log)
 - Fixed the issue where the previous boot's log was overwritten after restarting the AirStation when the log was configured to be transferred to a USB device.

(SNMP)
 - Fixed the issue where the number of packets could not be obtained properly from "ifInUcastPkts" object.

(system)
 - Fixed the issue where the AirStation sometimes hanged up.

(syslog)

 - Fixed the issue where MAC RADIUS was authenticating unnecessarily after the session was timed out.

 - Fixed the issue where devices were unable to connect to the RADIUS server if name resolution failed when the RADIUS server was specified by hostname.

(System)
 - Fixed the issue with the AirStation rebooting involuntarily.

(Syslog)
 - Now the boot information log is transferred to syslog server.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.12.5 (release date: 2014/03/10)
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
New features from v1.10.1 to v1.12.5 are listed below:

(VLAN)
 - Added multiple VLAN functionality.
You can configure an additional VLAN ID by selecting "Multiple" from each wired port or the SSID's VLAN mode. If enabled, the specified VLAN ID and additional VLAN ID can be transferred.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modified features from v1.10.1 to v1.12.5 are listed below:

(Wireless)
- Now you can choose "Basic Rate" from each bandwidth of the rate set (11n 1x and 11n 2x) when you select "User-defined" for the wireless band.

(RADIUS)
- MAC RADIUS authentication now allows re-authentication when a session times out.

(WebUI)
- When a USB device consumes excessive power, the following message is displayed: 
  "Connected USB device cannot be used due to excessive power consumption." 


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed bugs from v1.10.1 to v1.12.5 are listed below:

(Proxy ARP)
- ARP requests between wireless clients with the same SSID may be replied by proxy if proxy ARP is enabled. 

(Wireless)
- Fixed the problem of wireless communication not being available when the device's internal temperature fluctuates between extreme temperature variations.

 - Communication with connected wireless clients can now be established immediately when a wireless client roams.

(VLAN)
 - Fixed the communication failure between untagged ports in the following situation: 
2 WAPS-AG300Hs are connected by WDS that is set to "Tagged". 2 wired ports of one WAPS-AG300H are set to "Tagged" and the other's ports are set to "Untagged".

(BN-ADT, WL-ADT)
 - Now all configuration from BN-ADT and WL-ADT can be saved correctly.

 - Fixed the problem of wireless clients from other VLANs than the management VLAN not being counted as wireless clients.
